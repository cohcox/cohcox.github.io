<p>A demonstration of my projects and general experience, also containing the Capstone Project for my Computer Science Degree from Southern New Hampshire University.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at both Southern New Hampshire University and my professional career, I have learned a lot. Taking this previous coursework and enhancing it in multiple ways into a full functional program show cases much of what I have learned throughout my four years at the university and shows my potential in the career field of Computer Science. Throughout the course of this program, I have learned essential aspects of the career, whether it be game development or working with databases. On aspect that I really enjoyed was in a course where I was tasked with development of an application in Java which showcased my favorite albums and artists of all time. The catch was that my classmates and I were creating that application together, which meant we had to utilize version control so each of our contributions migrated well together. If successful, the program would run correctly, and we could all see one another's favorite music. Part of this same class introduced me to the idea of peer code reviews and what could be learned from them. Code review is now likely the biggest part of my development process. I am meticulously testing every function in pieces, then sending those snippets over to other developer friends I have for review, constantly trying to find ways to improve. This also held true for another course I had for game development that operated in much the same way. We utilized Discord to develop a plan, each team member taking on a separate task for development. We developed a fully functional demo of a first-person shooter from the bare-bones planning process all the way to playable (albeit rough) game complete with mechanics, AI and a beautiful GUI. Both my successes and failures during the last few years have built me into someone who is ready for the development world. Some of those successes and failures come from outside of the classroom, specifically in the job I had with software testing where I was afforded the ability to develop an application for symbolic links, which will also be linked below. My company had a business problem pertaining to syncing man wearable computers faster. I created a program that automatically zipped up and copied over files and folders for our business needs, complete with a user interface where a user could pick and choose what he/she would like to do. Throughout this process specifically I became used to working with seasoned developers of many different languages, and I got accustomed to being a “junior” while a “senior” sat behind me guiding me. Granted software development wasn’t in my job title, they saw my yearning to learn and let me peel off from my testing duties regularly enough to learn and hone my skills. I believe overall these experiences have melded me for a great introductory role I the software development world. Not the least of those experiences is my submission for my Computer Science capstone.</p><br>
<p>Speaking of that capstone, let’s go over what exactly that capstone involves. I was tasked with selecting an artifact from a previous course, or multiple artifacts, and then enhancing it/them in three key areas. Those areas are Software Design and Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. As one can tell, those are three massively important aspects of Computer Science and are meant to showcase a wide display of abilities within the field. Though my initial place involved enhancing two artifacts, I eventually only went with one so I could focus on making it the best possible representation that I could. In an earlier class I developed a Zoo Authenticator project in the Java language. Within that project was password protection and there was logic that inhibited data from falling on unnecessary eyes due to that password protection. Zookeepers could login and only access data that would be relevant to a Zookeeper, then a veterinarian could login and only see their required data. It was really a simple project where I learned mostly how to use Java language. I chose this as my enhancement project because it seemed as though it was a perfect fit to display all the various levels required of me. To showcase Software Development and Engineering I completely reworked the program into the Python language. Every aspect is now in a language that I am a little more comfortable with, but it was interesting taking another language and essentially transcribing it over to another. I initially had plans of adding in a graphic interface, but instead wanted to focus on functionality. A user can login through the command line with a specified password, then depending on that password they can access a .csv file which contains records for either animals or employees. I sectioned off most functionality into different functions as to make things more modular and hopefully more readable. I tried to take time and comment every section as well as I could. Regarding data structures and algorithms, I added in functionality that allows a user to search through the database by name, and then that gets displayed by whoever or whatever the user input. Users can add to and remove from existing records in a customizable fashion. Usernames are searched through the users.csv file to ensure that that username matches up with the password input. The enhancement to databases was used as the basis of this project. Every bit of data for the “Zoo” is encased in a zoodatabase database through MongoDB. With the use of the PyMongo module, queries are used to create, read, and delete records. The entire application runs through this system.</p>
