<h1>Cody Cox's ePortfolio</h1>

<p>A demonstration of my projects and general experience, also containing the Capstone Project for my Computer Science Degree from Southern New Hampshire University.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at both Southern New Hampshire University and my professional career, I have learned a lot. Taking this previuos coursework and enhancing it in multiple ways into a full functional program show cases much of what I have learned throughout my four years at the university, and shows my potential in the career field of Computer Science. Throughout the course of this program I have learned essential aspects of the career, whether it be game development or working with databases. On aspect that I really enjoyed was in a course where I was tasked with development of an application in Java which showcased my favorite albums and srtists of all time. The catch was that my classmates and I were creating that application together, which meant we had to utilize version control so each of our contributions migrated well together. If successful, the program as a whole would run correctly and we could all see one another's favorite music. Part of this same class introduced me to the idea of peer code reviews and what could be learned from them. Code review is now likely the biggest part of my development process. I am meticulously testing every function in pieces, then sending those snippets over to other developer friends I have for review, constantly trying to find ways to improve.</p>
